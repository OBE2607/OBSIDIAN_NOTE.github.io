### Start time format

The start time is optional and can be added in two formats:

- Date and time (e.g., `@ 2023-04-16T14:30`)

### Task completion and interruption

To complete or interrupt a task, execute the commands "Complete Task" or "Interrupt Task." Upon execution, the topmost incomplete task is checked, and the estimated time and scheduled start time are overwritten with the actual time taken and actual start time.
